1. Setup and Initialization:
     Webcam Capture: cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0) captures video from the webcam.
     Face Mesh: face_mesh = mp.solutions.face_mesh.FaceMesh(refine_landmarks=True) initializes the MediaPipe Face Mesh model with refined landmarks for more accurate tracking.
     Screen Dimensions: screen_w, screen_h = pyautogui.size() gets the dimensions of the screen for accurate cursor mapping.
2. Video Processing Loop:
    Frame Capture and Flip: The loop captures each frame and flips it horizontally to create a mirror effect.
    Color Conversion: The frame is converted from BGR (used by OpenCV) to RGB (used by MediaPipe).
    Face Mesh Processing: The face_mesh.process(rgb_frame) function processes the frame and detects facial landmarks.
3. Landmark Detection and Cursor Movement:
    Landmark Points: If facial landmarks are detected, the code extracts specific landmarks (landmarks 474 to 478) for controlling the mouse cursor. These landmarks correspond to the iris or near-eye regions.
    Cursor Mapping: The x and y coordinates of these landmarks are mapped from the frame dimensions to the screen dimensions, and the cursor is moved accordingly using pyautogui.moveTo(screen_x, screen_y).
4. Blink Detection for Clicking:
    Left Eye Blink Detection: The code tracks the distance between landmarks 145 and 159 to detect a blink. If the distance is less than a certain threshold (0.006), a left mouse click is simulated.
    Right Eye Blink Detection: Similarly, the distance between landmarks 374 and 386 is tracked to simulate a right mouse click when a blink is detected.
5. Visualization:
    Circles on Key Points: Green and yellow circles are drawn on the detected facial landmarks for visualization, making it easier to debug and see what the system is detecting.
6. Output and Display:
    Display Frame: The processed frame with the visual cues is displayed in a window titled "Eye Controlled Mouse."
    Continuous Loop: The loop continues indefinitely, updating the video feed and processing the landmarks in real-time.
Possible Improvements:
    Calibration: You might want to add calibration steps to ensure the accuracy of cursor movement.
    Sensitivity Adjustment: Fine-tuning the threshold values for blink detection to make the system more robust.
    Optimization: Since this runs in real-time, optimizing performance to reduce latency can be crucial for smoother cursor movement.
